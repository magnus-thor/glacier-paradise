    "p1": "We start our Snæfellsjökull “Midnight sun tour” in the evening from Anarstapi, a fishing village located on the south side of the peninsula close to Snæfellsjökull.",
    "p2": "Here we will hop on our vehicle and make our way to the foot of the glacier. Alternatively, you can follow our bus in your own car, if it is suitable for F-roads, as we drive a mountain pass along the side of the glacier. This gravel and bumpy F road offer spectacular views of the glacier and the surrounding area and it is a great part of this adventure. There for do we advise customers to start the journey with the bus so they can enjoy the scenery along the way",
    "p3": "Up on arrival it is time for the real fun to begin. We get on board the snow-cat to start our ascent to the top of the glacier, or as close to it as possible. The snow-cats used for the tour are specially equipped so travellers can enjoy the scenery along the way. Please take note of that these are the same sours as our “Top of the Diamond” tour except you get the added bonus of the magnificent magic of the midnight sun bathing the horizon with its mystical colour pallet. ",
    "p4": "From here there is a vast and incredible panorama: Hellissandur, Rif, the wide bay Breiðafjörður, and as far as the West fjords (Látrabjarg cliffs). The mountain’s rugged terrain is also impressive, as is the view south encompassing all of the gulf of Faxaflói, to Reykjavík and even beyond to Keflavík. These excursions are always fascinating, and it is important for travellers to realize that views from the glacier are dependent upon local weather conditions at any given moment."
